        <h2 class = "margin-bottom-sml">Alex Dibben</h2>
        <p class = "subtext align-left margin-bottom-sml">Managing Director</p>
        <p>As Managing Director, Alex's main responsibilities include the initial consultation with the client, delegation and overseeing of the project from start to finish. He is also responsible for quoting and invoicing clients and ensuring the whole process runs smoothly. </p>
        <p>Alex's work supports the wider team as he provides the initial direction for the project, from the initial consultation. He also guides the project through the appropriate personnel in our team through delegation, and manages the entire process to ensure we meet budgets and client requirements.</p>
        <p>From working with Alex, I have learned the importance of delegation and a number of important management skills, such as time management, organisation, people management and client management. As I look to progress in my career to more senior positions, I will take a number of these skills and apply them to my own approach.</p>
        <p>Alex will usually sit down with me if there is a task that needs completing and run me through what the client is looking for, the budget and often some ideas for the project. Throught the project I will be communicating with him to ensure I am along the right lines and he can keep track of progress.</p>

        <h2 class = "margin-bottom-sml">Ethan Wetherall</h2>
        <p class = "subtext align-left margin-bottom-sml">Head of Development</p>
        <p>Ethan's main responsiblities include managing the development process. After a design has been signed off, he will be given the build and the responsibility to delegate and manage the project as he sees fit to maximise efficiency and quality. He will often do large or difficult parts himself, and delegate pages or sections to others such as myself.</p>
        <p>Ethan's work supports the wider team and contributes to project success as he gives clear direction on tasks that need to be completed, he will support the development team if needed and checks everyone's work before progressing the project to ensure there are no issues.</p>
        <p>Ethan has taught me a lot to do with development. He has showed me how to set up a WordPress website, how to develop a website in line with our company practices, as well as some additional learning in PHP, for example. I interact with Ethan mainly for training purposes or to go through a task that he wants me to complete.</p>

        <h2 class = "margin-bottom-sml">Josh Wetherall</h2>
        <p class = "subtext align-left margin-bottom-sml">Project Manager / Head of Design</p>
        <p>As head of design, Josh is the first point of call after the initial consultation with the client. He takes the client's vision and brings it to life. Similarly to Ethan, Josh oversees the entire design process, delegating as he goes in order to meet budgets and timelines. He is also responsible for communicating with the development team to ensure the designs being made are able to be created within the development budget quoted by Alex.</p>
        <p>Josh's work supports the wider team as he is the person with the main role of ensuring client's requirements are met as well as the budgeting requirements of the development team. By ensuring he does this, the whole project can move forward smoothly with minimal back and fourth and a reduced chance of mistakes in the later stages.</p>
        <p>I have learned a lot of important design principles, softwares and practices from Josh. We will often have training sessions where he will teach me how to use a new software or create a certain element, for example. He will go through tasks with me, explaining the requirements of the client and then we will go through them together where he will give me advice and tips on how to optimise my designs going forward.</p>
