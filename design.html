    <p>The design stage is where the outputs of the first two stages begin to come to life. The design team will begin structuring the project, and the goals and nature of the project will have a distinct effect at this stage. For example, the design stage for a website would look very different to the design stage of an automation software. Despite this, the basic principles remain the same, such as the design matching up with the visions of the client.

<p><strong>Inputs - </strong>Project roadmap, sitemaps, specification documents, feature lists, UX Research</p>
<p><strong>Outputs - </strong>Visual templates/mockups, prototypes, technical foundations</p>
<p><strong>People Involved - </strong>Designers, lead developers, project managers, client</p>
