                <h3>AFC Bournemouth</h3>
                <p>I began playing for AFC Bournemouth's academy at the age of 8 and received my first contract at u9. I played for AFCB until U16 where I was released before my scholarship. Whilst there, I achieved a lot of great accomplishments, and learned a lot of valuable transferrable skills from a very young age.</p>

            <div class = "text-line">
                <h3 class = "align-right">Poole Town FC</h3>
                <P>My season at Poole Town FC marked the beginning of my semi-professional career and also my transition into men's football at the age of 17. I played for Poole Town during the 2023/24 season, where I made over 30 appearances and scored 4 goals. Playing step 3 football at such a young age earned me a lot of interest and trials at professional clubs. Unfortunately, this didn't amount to anything and my semi-pro career continued.</P>
            </div>
            <div class = "text-line">
                <h3>Dorchester Town FC</h3>
                <p>I moved to Dorchester Town FC after my season at Poole Town, due to receiving an improved contract and also being close with the manager. I played for Dorchester Town for the 2024/25 season. Unfortunately, this season didn't go to plan as I had limited game time which halted my career development. Despite this, Dorchester offered to renew my contract with the promise of more regular game time in the new season, and so this is where I will be playing for the upcoming 2025/26 season.</p>
