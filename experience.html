            <h3>Line Cook / Kitchen Porter</h3>
            <p>I began working at the Raft Cafe when I was 15. I worked in the kitchen, and my job was to prepare orders which came into the kitchen. The food was simple to make, however I learned many valuable skills in this role, one of the main ones being time management and organisation. This is because I had to ensure that orders with multiple items were all finished at the same time, and I also had to ensure I had enough stock at any given time to prepare the orders. I had to keep the kitchen tidy, and also learned valuable communication skills as I was often working with others.</p>

            <h3>Crew Member - Crew Trainer - Shift Manager</h3>
            <p>I began working at McDonald's when I was 16. I began as a crew member, before quickly being promoted to a crew trainer within my first couple of months. I then became a shift manager before I turned 18, which I believe is a credit to my hard work and pride in being the best at any endeavour. This role taught me a number of valuable skills and introduced me to the world of management, which is a challenge I thoroughly enjoyed, and something which I hope to implement into my new career path in the future.</p>
