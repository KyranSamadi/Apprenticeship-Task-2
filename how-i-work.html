            I believe that I work best in a team, collaborative environment, and I believe this is a result of my background in football, where I played for AFC Bournemouth from the age of 9 until I was 16. This was an extremely professional environment where I learned a lot of valuable transferrable skills, one of the most crucial being my ability to work in a team. When working on a project, I enjoy working together with others in order to achieve a common goal. I feel this process allows for a number of different persepctives on a given project, as well as a number of different skillsets which I believe only results in a better outcome. Furthemore, I believe that working collaboratively with others is one of the best ways I learn. This is because I am able to observe those more experienced than me and pick up on new skills and best practices which I can then implement into my own workflow.
        </p>

            I also work hard to continue learning new skills and ensure my current skills remain at a high level. I do this through online learning using platforms such as Udemy and YouTube. I find this method of learning useful as I am able to learn at my own pace, as well as being able to pause and practice the skills on display. I am also learning and honing skills in the workplace, by shadowing other colleagues, using new software and completing tasks to implement them in a practical environment.

        <h2>Communication Style</h2>
        <p>Communication is critical to a professional working environment. Regardless of power dynamics, effective and correct communication can enhance workplace efficiency whilst simultaneously creating an environment of transparency and trust, minimising miscommunications and mistakes caused as a result of poor communication. Generally, there is verbal/nonverbal and written communication in a professional working environment, each being suitable in different scenarios and having their individual benefits and drawbacks.</p>

        <p>I personally prefer to communicate verbally, especially in matters of urgency. This is because there is little chance to misunderstand or misinterpret information due to the additional visual cues such as facial expressions which are present when verbally communicating. This also ensures that within the professional working environment there is less opportunity for mistakes. Moreover, you are able to obtain an instant response when verbally communicating which can be very beneficial in almost all cases. This preference could also stem from my background in football, which is an environment where you are constantly communicating verbally with teammates.</p>
            
        <p>Despite this, in the workplace, we use a number of different communication methods and platforms. For example, we use Zoho Cliq in order to communicate with each other and provide updates on projects. When communicating with clients, we do this either through email or meetings, depending on the urgency on the situation, as well as the collaborative nature of it. In cases where it is a heavily collaborative project, we would likely have more meetings with the client. We use these communication methods with clients as they are more professional and formal.</p>
